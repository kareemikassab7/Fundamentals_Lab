Hello there,
this program takes a string and checks whther its a plaindrome or not. then changes it into a plaindrome
------------------------------------------------------------------------
there is a make file which contains Rules to generate:
executable file "plaindrome" using object codes[prerequisites]
object codes using assembly codes[prerequisite]
assembly codes using preprocessed codes [prerequisite]
preprocessed codes using source codes [prerequisite]

the code is in "plaindrome.cpp" with suitable file kind extension
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
to build the program: simple enter the directory on the terminal and type "make"
it will produce plaindrome
----------------------------------------------------------
to run the program, execute through ./plaindrome
it will ask about the size of the text (consider spaces)
enter the word
it will tell you whether it is or not and displays the new plaindrome
