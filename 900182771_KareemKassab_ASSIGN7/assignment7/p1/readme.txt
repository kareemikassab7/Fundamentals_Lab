Hello there,
this program takes the size of 3 stacks of cylinders (blocks) of unequal length, gets the highest length possible that can be formed by the cylinders and returns that maximum common length
---------------------------------------------------------------------
there is a make file which contains Rules to generate:
executable file "EQLSTK" using object codes[prerequisites]
object codes using source codes[prerequisite]

the code is in "eqlstk.cpp" with suitable file kind extension
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
to build the program: simple enter the directoryu on the terminal and type "make"
it will produce EQLSTK
----------------------------------------------------------
to run the program, execute through ./EQLSTK
enter the 3 stack sizes separated by spaces, then enter the content of each stack separated by spaces too
results will be automatically displayed on the screen
