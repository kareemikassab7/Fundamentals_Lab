Hello there,
this program should take the points representing an object and calculate its perimeter and area including(square, circle, rectangle, triangle, house, and RecCircle)

NOTE:THE CURRENT LIST ISNT WORKING AT THE MOMENT ,HADEER SAID ITS NOT REQUIRED AT THE MOMENT, THE ENTRY WONT CHANGE THE PROGRAM BEHAVIOUR. THE PROGRAM WILL TEST WITH RECCIRCLE THEN A HOUSE ALWAys


NOTE: THE PROGRAM CAN PRODUCE A NEGATIVE SIGN DUE TO POINT ENTRIES< IT SHOULD BE IGNORED

------------------------------------------------------------------------
there is a make file which contains Rules to generate:
executable file "GEOOBJ" using object codes[prerequisites]
object codes using source file "Source.cpp"
the code is in "main" with suitable file kind extension
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
to build the program, simply open its directory in the terminal and make
then execute through "./GEOOBJ"
-------------------------------------------------------------
to run the program, execute through ./GEOOBJ
enter X,Y coordinates of each point alternatively until the area and perimeter are displayed for the RECCIRCLE, the do the same for the HOUSE example



                                                   %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% HAVE A NICE DAY!!%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
