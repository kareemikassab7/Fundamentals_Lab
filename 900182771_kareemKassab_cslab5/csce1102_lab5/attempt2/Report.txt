- write main function that takes 2 parameters argc and argv
- take a file name and number of required threads
- make an array of future variables where each variable stores the returned value of processed students by its thread
- calculate the whole number of processed students by adding future variables in a for loop
- create an array of threads and make them join in a for loop that counts and prints
- to ensure synchronization, add a mutext.lock and mutex.unlock around the while loop in the studentfile.cpp
- dont forget to declare the mutex in the studentfile.h
