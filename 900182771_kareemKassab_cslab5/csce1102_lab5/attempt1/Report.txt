- write a mian function that takes argc (the number of parameters) and argv(string displays parameter)
- add a checking if statement to make sure that more than 1 file is passed
- create a 2D array using calloc array of pointers
- instantiate an object of the class studentlist
- create an array of threads with a number equal to the passed files (argc)
- implement a loop so that each thread reads from a file 
- make another loop to join threads and make the main wait
- delete the linked list so that the destructor is called and prints the data
- make a mutex variable lock in the student list so that threads do not interrupt each other (shared among different methods)
- put mutex lock and unlock around append method
