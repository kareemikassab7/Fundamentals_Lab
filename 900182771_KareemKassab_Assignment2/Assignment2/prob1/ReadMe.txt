Hello there,
this program converts from RGB scale to greyscale theoritically through averaging the components of Red, Green, and Blue colors in each pixel assuming that the pixels are structs in a 2-D array formation!
------------------------------------------------------------------------
there is a make file which contains Rules to generate:
executable file "RGB" (in bin) using object codes (in obj)[prerequisites]
object codes (in obj) using assembly codes(in asm) [prerequisite]
assembly codes (in asm)  using preprocessed codes (in preprocessed) [prerequisite]
preprocessed codes (in preprocessed) using source codes (in sources) [prerequisite]

code files are named: "colors" and "main" with suitable file kind extensions.
the function that calculates average is in "colors"
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Also, it contains a makefile.vars file which contains variables that carry paths for such directories to simplify code typing in the makefile, and variables that act as flags for ( -E, -S, -c, -o)
-----------------------------------------------------------
to run the program, go to bin through the terminal and execute through ./RGB
u enter the required number of rows and columns then enter the data for each element, the program gets the averages and outputs them to you (same concept as redisplaying with grey scale.
