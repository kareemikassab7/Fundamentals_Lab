how to ammend,
The client:
- add the terminate with error function for an initial check
- use get arguments function to get whats written on the terminal
- put the main code in a while true loop to run indefinitley
- declare a socket
you will need to add the following to the code in the slides which connects and sends to a server that is listening
1- a variable that stores the length of the command
2- a send function that sends this length
3- a send function that sends the body of the command
4- a buffer that is initiated with 0's
5- a recevier for the buffer
6- a close function





The server:

- add the terminate with error function for an initial check
- put the main code in a while true loop to run indefinitley
- declare a socket
- make sure the socket uses INET 
- use the portal 8707
- the accept and listen functions are implemented in the slides
-make the read bytes equal to what is received

you will need to add:
- a file pointer
- fseek and ftell to measure the size
- a variable that carries that size
-allocate a space for the buffer using calloc
- read the file using fread
- close popen with pclose
-close sockets
